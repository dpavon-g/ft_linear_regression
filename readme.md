Introduction to machine learning project provided by the Artificial Intelligence branch of the 42 Network.




## About the project

The main goal of this project is to implement by using linear regression the price of a car given its mileage.

To do this, we need to develop two programs. One of them is responsible for predicting the car's price based on its mileage, and the other is tasked with training the model to effectively adjust the parameters needed for the first program to predict the price.

## The algorithm

To train the model and correctly solve the problem, we will implement the gradient descent algorithm. This algorithm is widely used in the fields of machine learning, data science, and mathematics to minimize the prediction error.
